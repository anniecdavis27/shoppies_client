# Project Description

Shoppies Client is the frontend UI to the Shoppies App, a web application that searches for movies from OMDb that can be nominated for The Shoppies - Movie Awards for Entrepreneurs. Nominated movies can be saved and deleted from the Shoppies API database.

(Note: In reality, The Shoppies Awards, hosted by [TSC](https://www.tsc.ca/) nominates brands from their affiliated ecommerce store. For the purpose of this internship application project, I am using movies.)
